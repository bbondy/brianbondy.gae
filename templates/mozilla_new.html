<h2>New to Mozilla</h2>
<div class='bold-divider'></div>

<p>
If you want to get into the Mozilla community, this page will help you get your foot in the door.  A Mozilla community member is called a Mozillian.  
</p>

<p>
The best place to get involved is still by going through the <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/'>Mozilla contribute</a> page.  This page will just summarize some starting points of getting involved.
</p>

<p>
People often become a Mozillian for a variety of reasons including: Wanting to help the project, wanting to develop their own skills, wanting to put something extra on their resume, or even wanting to get a job at Mozilla.
</p>

<h2>Find out where you belong</h2>
<div class='bold-divider'></div>
<p>
Find out what you want to help with.  The best way to do that is by reading the <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/areas.html'>ways to contribute page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance (QA) and testing</h2>
<div class='bold-divider'></div>

<p>
Here are some ways to get started with QA:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi'>Setup an account on Bugzilla</a>.</li>
<li><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Confirming_unconfirmed_bugs'>Confirm unconfirmed bugs</a>.  For example here are the <a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&product=Core&product=Firefox&product=Toolkit&op_sys=Windows%20XP&op_sys=Windows%20Server%202003&op_sys=Windows%20Vista&op_sys=Windows%207&bugidtype=include&chfieldfrom=-72h&chfieldto=Now&chfield=%5BBug%20creation%5D&list_id=1399227'>incoming Windows bugs</a> for the last 3 days.</li>
<li>Confirm bugs that are marked as fixed and say they are verified</li>
<li>Post new bugs you find</li>
<li><a href='http://www.gerv.net/hacking/before-you-mail-gerv.html'>Contact gerv</a> to get editbug privs once you are ready</li>
<li><a href='https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC'>Join IRC</a> and hang out in the relevant channels</li>
<li>Try to find a mentor who can help you along the way</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developers</h2>
<div class='bold-divider'></div>
<p>
Here are some ways to get started with development:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by doing everything in the Quality Assurance section</li>
<li>Make a <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide'>build</a> by reading the developers guide</li>
<li>If you are working on core code frequent the <a href='http://www.brianbondy.com/mozilla/cheatsheet/'>Platform Developer Cheat Sheet</a> page which is a cheat sheet lookup for common tasks you'll be doing</li>
<li>Try to find a mentor who can help you along the way</li>
</ul>

<h2>Firefox builds</h2>
<div class='bold-divider'></div>
<p>
Mozilla Firefox has 4 different release channels: Release, Beta, Aurora, and Nightly.
</p>

<p>
The Firefox Release channel is the currently released Firefox version.   If Firefox Release was for example version 7, then Beta would be version 8, Aurora would be version 9, and Nightly would be version 10.  Every 6 weeks each of these channels shift one to the left and Nightly gets a new version, in my example Nightly would become version 11.
</p>

<p>
You can download the builds here:

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/?from=getfirefox'>Firefox Release</a></li>
<li><a href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/'>Firefox Beta</a></li>
<li><a href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/'>Firefox Aurora</a></li>
<li><a href='http://nightly.mozilla.org/'>Firefox Nightly</a></li>
