<h2>Why this section?</h2>
<div class='bold-divider'></div>
<p>

There are 2 things you can do with your time:
<ol>
  <li>Produce</li>
  <li>Consume</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
A good deveoper understands this difference and has a proven background of produced products.  A good developer also <a href='/other/books/'>consumes</a> new information constantly.  A good developer has a good balance of both.
</p>

<p>
Listed below are some of the projects I've worked on in the past years.
